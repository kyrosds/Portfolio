## Goals as a Frontend developer

Currently my goals as a Frontend developer include:

1. first getting started at a tech company that is willing to show me the ropes and help become an efficient programmer
2. Once I have achieved that first goal as simple as it sounds it is still a huge step, I will then focus my attention on possibly doing some free lance work while also continuing to work for a company.
3. The next thing I would like to accomplish is becoming a frontend developer that can help other people become good at programming as well. I feel that it has been a long journey for me to even just get to this point and I know I still have a long ways to go. So knowing more of what it takes to become a programmer and how frustrating it can be I want to help others to not give up and continue to strive to achieve your passion because eventually it will happen as long as you can stay the course.
