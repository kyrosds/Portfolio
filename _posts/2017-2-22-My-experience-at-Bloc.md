## Experience at Bloc so far

I am about two months into the Bloc curriculum and so far I found it very good and overwhelming at times. It goes into a lot of depth of each aspect of the Web Development languages such as Html, CSS, and JavaScript as well as touching a little on JQuery. Later in the curriculum I will start to learn more about the back-end languages such as Ruby. Since I have finished my first project with Bloc I was happy with the outcome and glad to have the first project be more of a step-by-step how to, instead of diving right in and trying to figure it out. Even with the project being on training wheels it went over quite a bit and it felt overwhelming at times since I knew that I would have to eventually and soon do all of this on my own, I am a little nervous to begin the next few projects and excited at the same time. Overall Bloc has been a good thing for me and I feel like I am learning more now than I have in the past trying to learn it on my own.
