## Explanation

This music player stores all of your albums and allows you to stream your music through the built in player.

## Problem

I was given a task to create the music player using Html, CSS, and JavaScript later refactoring the program into JQuery.

## Solution

I was able to accomplish the tasks that were laid out going through a step-by-step process that was laid out by the Bloc curriculum.

## Results

The final product consisted of a completed and refactored program that played the music of the selected album, allowing the user to switch from song to song, adjust the volume, and move to different places in the music track from within the music player.
This project is available at this website: (http://david-bloc-jams-angular.herokuapp.com/ Bloc Jams)

## Conclusion

The following tasks were accomplished within the project:

* Created functional code through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Re-factored the original code from JQuery into AngularJS
* The music player functioned as it was intended per the curriculum instructions
* Deployed the project to a cloud based platform allowing for access to the project from anywhere.
