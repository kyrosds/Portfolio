## Explanation

Chat room application that is updated in real-time using Firebase database. This application allows you to create a new room or join and existing room and communicate with the other people that are also logged into the chat room.

## Problem

Building this application required access to a database that stored all of the information being input into the chat application, learning how to link everything was a bit challenging at first but once I setup the initial connection adding the ability to send and receive messages, add new rooms, or create a user login became easier to understand. Getting everything to display properly was also another problem that I had with the new application.  

## Solution

Linking the application and the database was just a matter of having all of the correcting links applied and the correct syntax within the application. Learning what needed to be linked and how required some research to accomplish but with plenty of resources I was able to find everything I needed to complete the task. The second problem was more to do with having the proper syntax within the html, CSS, and JavaScript files, this was just a matter of trying different ways with going about things mostly in CSS and getting everything to look the way it is supposed to.  

## Results

The results of the application is functional chat room application that displays everything as it was intended. The application is also available to view on its own website: (https://david-bloc-chat.herokuapp.com/ Bloc Chat project)

## Conclusion

The following was accomplished within this project:

* Created functional code through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Used the AngularJS framework throughout the project.
* Used Firebase platform to develop a fully functional chat room application.
* Deployed the project to a cloud based platform allowing for access to the project from anywhere.
